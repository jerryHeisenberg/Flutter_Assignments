1.Create a list of integers and find the longest subsequence of consecutive numbers in the list.

2.Create a map that associates the names of cities with their latitude and longitude coordinates. Given a starting and ending city, find the shortest distance between them (you can assume a spherical Earth).

3.Create a list of maps, where each map represents a product with a name, price, and quantity. Sort the list by the total cost of each product (price x quantity) in descending order.

4.Create a map that associates the names of countries with their population and area. Find the top 5 largest countries by population density (population / area).

5.Create a list of strings and find the longest common subsequence (substring) among all the strings in the list.
